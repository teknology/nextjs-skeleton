### Purpose of the Tenant Model:

1.  **Isolating Resources**:

    - Each **tenant** manages its own resources such as websites, users, and templates. This ensures that one tenant's data is not visible or accessible to another tenant.
    - In your case, a **tenant** would represent a group or organization that owns multiple websites, templates, and possibly other configurations specific to that tenant.

2.  **Supporting Multiple Clients/Organizations**:

    - In a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform, multiple clients or organizations use the same application. Each client is represented by a **tenant**, enabling the platform to cater to multiple users while ensuring data privacy and separation between different clients.
    - For example, an **eCommerce tenant** could have one set of websites, users, and templates, while a **Doctor tenant** could have its own separate set of websites and templates.

3.  **Managing Websites and Templates**:

    - The **Tenant** model allows you to group websites, templates, and configurations under a single organizational entity. Each **tenant** can have a specific configuration for the **Website** and **TemplateGroup** models, customized for that tenant's needs.
    - For example, a tenant could manage an eCommerce website and associated templates, while another tenant might manage a doctor’s website with its own set of templates.

4.  **Scaling the Platform**:

    - The **tenant** model allows your application to scale efficiently by grouping data and configurations. As your platform grows, tenants enable you to efficiently manage different groups of users and resources under a common framework.

5.  **Data and Configuration Customization**:

    - **Tenants** can have custom domains, websites, and settings that are tailored specifically for them. This allows each tenant to have unique configurations (e.g., themes, template variations) without affecting other tenants on the platform.
    - For instance, one tenant might have a custom theme and website structure suited for an online store, while another tenant might be using the platform to manage a hospital’s appointment booking system.

6.  **Monetization and Billing**:

    - Tenants can also serve as a basis for **billing** or **subscription** management in a SaaS platform. Each tenant might be billed separately based on their usage, resources (e.g., number of websites), or plan type.
    - You can associate billing features with tenants to track resource usage and charge clients based on their tenant account.

### Use Case Examples:

1.  **eCommerce Platform**:

    - A company signs up on the platform as a **tenant**. They may create multiple eCommerce websites (each a **Website** under the tenant) for different product categories (e.g., fashion, electronics).
    - Each website can have its own customized templates, but they all belong to the same tenant.

2.  **Doctor's Website Platform**:

    - A medical group signs up on the platform as a **tenant**. They create websites for different locations (each **Website** under the tenant) for their clinics, each offering services like online booking, doctor information, etc.
    - The templates for appointment booking, calendars, and confirmation pages are all specific to that tenant.

3.  **Event Management System**:

    - An event management company becomes a **tenant** and creates websites for different events (e.g., conferences, trade shows).
    - Each event has its own site (a **Website** under the tenant), but they share common features like ticket booking or speaker information.
